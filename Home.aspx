    <h4>Radioactive Man</h4>
    <p>The Internet King? I wonder if he could provide faster nudity&hellip; &hellip;And the fluffy kitten played with that ball of string all through the night. On a lighter note, a Kwik-E-Mart clerk was brutally murdered last night. Don't kid yourself, Jimmy. If a cow ever got the chance, he'd eat you and everyone you care about!</p>
    <h4>Marge vs. Monorail</h4>
    <p>I'm normally not a praying man, but if you're up there, please save me, Superman. When will I learn? The answers to life's problems aren't at the bottom of a bottle, they're on TV! I can't go to juvie. They use guys like me as currency. Homer no function beer well without. Oh, so they have Internet on computers now! Whoa, slow down there, maestro. There's a *New* Mexico?</p>
